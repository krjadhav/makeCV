name: atlas-plan
description: Create executable plan for the current phase (3-5 tasks). Reads the canonical plan command doc and produces/updates the current PLAN.md referenced from STATE.md. No implementation.
---

Read the canonical plan command markdown at `.claude/commands/atlas/plan.md` and follow it exactly.

Codex command style:
- Replace any `/atlas:<command>` references from canonical docs with `$atlas:<command>` in Codex responses.

Safety: do not implement code; only produce plan artifacts.
