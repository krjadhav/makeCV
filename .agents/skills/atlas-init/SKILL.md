description: Initialize project with CLAUDE.md, STATE.md, and ROADMAP.md by following the canonical init command doc.
---

Read the canonical init command markdown at `.claude/commands/atlas/init.md` and follow it exactly.

Codex command style:
- Replace any `/atlas:<command>` references from canonical docs with `$atlas:<command>` in Codex responses.

Safety: preserve existing project context; do not overwrite user-authored planning files without explicit confirmation.
